castv2-client
=============
### A Chromecast client based on the new (CASTV2) protocol

This module implements a Chromecast client over the new (CASTV2) protocol. A sender app for the `DefaultMediaPlayer` application is provided, as well as an `Application` base class and implementations of the basic protocols (see the `controllers` directory) that should make implementing custom senders a breeze. 

For details about the protocol internals please see [https://github.com/thibauts/node-castv2](https://github.com/thibauts/node-castv2#protocol-description).
